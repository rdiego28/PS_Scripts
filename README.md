## Introduction

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language developed by Microsoft, specifically designed for task automation and configuration management. This repository serves as a central hub for my PowerShell scripts, making it easy to access, use, and share them with the community.

## Scripts

Here's a list of some of the scripts you'll find in this repository:

1. **Computer_report(html).ps1**: It generates a brief computer report in a html file.
2. **Get_HWID.ps1**: It generates a file with the Autopilot Hardware hash.

Feel free to explore them.

## Usage

To use any of the scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/rdiego28/PS_Scripts.git`
2. Navigate to the desired script's directory: `cd PS_Scripts`
3. Run the script using PowerShell: `./script-name.ps1`
   
Make sure to review the script's code before running it to understand its functionality and potential impact on your system.

Happy scripting!

Diego.
